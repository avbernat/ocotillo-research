Data on growth form of Fouquieria splendens, with individual height, circumference, number of branches, and terminal segment length interquartile range (IQR). Additional information on elevation, nearest major interspecific plant distance and identity, nearest intraspecific plant distance, nearest arroyo distance and identity, and the count and identities of minor interspecific plants within 1 meter from the base of individual ocotillos.

For details see paper.
