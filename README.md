# ocotillo-research
In the summer of 2019, our team embarked on a 2-3 week long trip across the American West. We conducted research on the one of the strangest woody shrubs in the Sonoran Desert near the Mexico-United States border - the ocotillo. Known for its wand-like branches, red blooming flowers, and its inverted conical shape, Fouquieria splendens (F. spendens) is not just perplexing but also quite beautiful. In this repository, we have stashed our findings on this particularly strange plant and hope to share to others our analytical framework.
